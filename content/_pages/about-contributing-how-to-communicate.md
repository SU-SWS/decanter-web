## Slack

The Decanter team is on Slack, which is the best way for Stanford Community members to learn about new releases and ask questions. Our Slack channel is called: [\#decanter](https://stanfordwebservices.slack.com/archives/C9SL2179B)

## CoP

As more campus partners and vendors use Decanter, the Decanter team is considering a Community of Practice around Decanter. If you are interested, please let us know on Slack.
