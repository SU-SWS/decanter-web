# Designers 

Through our Decanter Design System toolkit on Figma, you can start with a preexisting library of components and built in type and color styles. Grids, modular spacing, and responsive design has also been fully implemented in this designer toolkit. Take all of the foundational objects that are useful to you and unsync from an objects master component to generate a starting point for modifying your cards, banners, buttons, etc. It's a great resource to use directly or to modify however your project needs. 

## How to use 

Figma does not currently have the single sign on functionality in place for the educational context that would allow us to move forward with an organizational license. We are continuing to work with them to add this functionality, but have no estimated date of delivery. For your current projects, please hang in there, we will either find a solution with Figma, or transfer to another platform to secure our Stanford enterprise solution for the Design System Library.
