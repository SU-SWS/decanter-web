The following guidelines are meant to help designers and developers who are contributing new visual work to Decanter. To find out if a visual work is already in progress CHECK HERE (Kerri to add link. Yvonne mentioned you had a page.)

## Criteria for acceptance for new work

New design work must meet the following criteria:

* Must have clear use case and be reusable 
* Must be accessible and usable
* Must be technically feasible
* Decanter designers will do a design review

The following resources will help you.

## Responsive grids

Our team has built grids for each range of breakpoints described in the kit. When you subscribe to the Stanford Design Library through your own Figma Project, you’ll have access to employ these grids on your own work through the Figma UI. 

[Review our responsive grids here](/page/layouts-responsive-design/)

## Modular spacing

In an attempt to provide designers a method to employ consistent spaces between UI objects (and to complete that concept through to code), our teams have constructed “modular spacers” across all ranges of breakpoints.

## Typography

Typographic styles have been built to include a range of practicality across your components. As with the full System itself, our teams have worked hard to optimize the number of styles we’ve created to the most needed and used styles across digital communications. They are deliberately generic and not tied to any semantic markup (aka, Display A is not necessarily an H1, and Display B does not need to be the H2, or only style of H2 on any given page). Another practical example is our choice to include two base paragraph styles. A “big paragraph text” style, and a “small paragraph text” style. We needed the differentiator because we saw a use of both heavily across many design projects. The “big” style provides the body copy option for long lengths of text running down a page, with font size that is readable without leaning in or squinting at your screen, and line height that is opened up to allow for the eye to rest in between jumping from one line of text to the next. The “small” style is slightly smaller font size than the “big” style and with a tighter line height to be used as summary text in the condensed space of a card for example. This style should be used for 3-5 lines of copy at the most, and for line lengths that are foreshortened, again, like in a card. Unlike with the “big” style, the line height is tighter to help the eye track between short lines, to prevent losing your place. Additional styles include “button text”, “displays C-E”, “caption”, “credit”, bullets, and number more.

## Color

Included in the Stanford Design System are colors drawn directly from the Stanford Brand Guidelines. Much like each of the other tools, colors from the library can be picked up and used in your projects as soon as you turn on the Stanford Design System Library.
