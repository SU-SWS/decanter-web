<p class="su-alert"><strong>Please note:</strong> Figma does not currently have the single sign on functionality in place for the educational context that would allow us to move forward with an organizational license. We are continuing to work with them to add this functionality, but have no estimated time of delivery.</p>

## In the mean time
