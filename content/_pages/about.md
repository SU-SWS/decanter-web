READY FOR REVIEW

## Decanter is Stanford’s open source design and frontend framework for digital products and experiences. Decanter includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with Stanford’s brand guidelines and best practices.

As a foundation for digital product development, Decanter provides a set of reusable components, style variables, design assets, and a responsive layout system that can be used in any Stanford project. Guidance for teams to efficiently build high-quality, user friendly, and accessible websites is also provided. 

Decanter is made up up two elements: the Decanter Design System and the Decanter Front-End Framework.

Decanter is maintained by a core team of designers, developers, and writers at Stanford dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Decanter welcomes collaboration with the Stanford digital community to help evolve the system to suit changing product needs.
