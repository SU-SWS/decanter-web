Decanter is Stanford’s open source design and frontend framework for digital products and experiences. Decanter includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with Stanford’s brand guidelines and best practices. 

As a foundation for digital product development, the Decanter Design System provides a set of reusable components, style variables, design assets, and guidance for teams to efficiently build high quality and accessible user interfaces. 

Decanter is maintained by a core team of designers, developers, and writers at Stanford dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Decanter welcomes collaboration with the Stanford digital community to help evolve the system to suit changing product needs.
