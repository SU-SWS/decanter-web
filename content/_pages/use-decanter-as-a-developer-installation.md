So, you want to use Decanter in your project? Good choice! Here are a couple of options on how to integrate Decanter with your work.

## I just need the static assets

You're in luck, Decanter has pre-compiled assets ready for you to add to your project. What you will need to do is the following

1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter/releases/
2. Copy the contents of `/core/dist` to where you store css, javascript, and file assets in your project.
3. Add the stylesheet (decanter.css) to the `<head>` of your html
4. Add the javascript (decanter.js) to the `<head>` or just below the `<body>` tag of your html
5. Profit!
