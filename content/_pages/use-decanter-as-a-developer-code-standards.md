### TODO

Developer Conventions

- Releases will be using semantic versioning

- No global variables in function calls
- No globally overridden variables in partials
- Formatting conventions

- Workflow
  - Master branch is master NO COMMITTING DIRECTLY
  - Releases go off master branch or a release branch
  - Following NPM semantic versioning
  - Everything is a pull request
  - Master should always be stable
  - Github issue queue to track issues and work
- .scss files not .sass
