<p class="su-intro-text">The collaborative work between University Communications and Stanford Web Services is key to achieving our goals in brand compliance.</p>

## Aligning with the Stanford brand using Decanter

Since the inception of web platforms for Stanford—in html, and on Drupal and Wordpress—our teams have been working to solve these challenges for the University with a primary goal: make it easy for websites to easily use elements from the Stanford Identity and make the treatment of the brand consistent in a select number of areas. 

### Tools for brand compliance

All official websites across our University are strongly encouraged to have three critical components to align with the Stanford identity. 

* Brand bar
* Local header 
* Global footer 

Outside of these three components, we urge website creators to adhere to typographic recommendations and some color recommendations, but in general terms, the University wants teams to feel free to be innovative and creative in how they interpret and express the Stanford brand.

Our brand team at University Communications has documented all of the tools, best practices, and guidance on the Stanford Identity website.
