## Achieving brand compliance with Decanter

The collaborative work between University Communications and Stanford Web Services is key to achieving our goals in brand compliance. Since the inception of web platforms for Stanford, on Drupal and Wordpress our teams have been working to solve these challenges for the University with a primary goal: make it easy for websites to be brand compliant and make the treatment of the brand consistent in a select number of areas. 

### Tools for brand compliance

All websites across our University are encouraged to have three critical components that allow them to achieve their brand compliance. 

* Brand bar
* Local header 
* Global footer 

Outside of these three components, we urge website creators to adhere to typographic recommendations and some color recommendations, but in general terms, the brand wants teams to feel free to be innovative and creative in how they interpret and express the Stanford brand. 

#### Brand Bar Overview

The inception for the brand bar came out of a usability need to provide a "home" for all Stanford websites both visually and functionally. This bar—containing the Stanford logo—anchors to the top of your website, above your local header. It serves visually as the main Stanford University mark, and functionally, it links back to stanford.edu. Because of the enormity of Stanford University and the thousands of web properties across the organization, by providing a consistent global "bar" at the top of sites with the ability for users to "go home" makes our ecosystem of sites feel deliberate and understandable to users.
