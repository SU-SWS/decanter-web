## Aligning with the Stanford brand using Decanter

Since the inception of web platforms for Stanford—in html, and on Drupal and Wordpress—our teams have been working to solve these challenges for the University with a primary goal: make it easy for websites to easily use elements from the Stanford Identity and make the treatment of the brand consistent in a select number of areas. 

### Tools for brand compliance

All official websites across our University are strongly encouraged to have three critical components to align with the Stanford identity. 

* Brand bar
* Local header 
* Global footer 

Outside of these three components, we urge website creators to adhere to typographic recommendations and some color recommendations, but in general terms, the University wants teams to feel free to be innovative and creative in how they interpret and express the Stanford brand. 

#### Brand bar overview

The inception for the brand bar came out of a usability need to provide a "home" for all Stanford websites both visually and functionally.</p>

<p>This bar—containing the Stanford logo—anchors to the top of your website, above your local header. It serves visually as the main Stanford University mark, and functionally, it links back to stanford.edu. Because of the enormity of Stanford University and the thousands of web properties across the organization, by providing a consistent global "bar" at the top of sites with the ability for users to "go home" makes our ecosystem of sites feel deliberate and understandable to users.</p>

#### Local header overview

The local header is a complex component, including some of the most critical parts of your website—your logo, Stanford or not, your local site search, and your main navigation.

</br>

Our Decanter team has gone to great lengths to create **logos** for your websites that are compliant with identity guidelines depending on how your organization is situated in the organization. 

The **local search**—though becoming less important to many users because of traffic coming into your sites "sideways" (Google dominates deep searches, leading users directly to content pages within the site, instead of starting at your homepage)—is still a very important tool to your users, the ones that use it. This functionality has been fully accessibility tested, as are all of our components. 

Your **main navigation** is one of the most critical parts of your website. That top level of navigation serves as the main buckets of entry for your users—regardless of how they enter your site, sideways or directly from the homepage. It is critical that this navigation—which collapses to a mobile navigation for smaller devices—and your in-page left sidebar of secondary navigation on interior pages is both usable and accessible. Our developers have fully tested and vetted the accessibility of this feature. [Learn more about achieving accessibility](https://elegant-poitras-87214a.netlify.com/page/page-about-why-decanter-accessibility/). Additionally, our user experience team has gone to great lengths to test the usability of the navigation. Both from conceptual questions around whether users are "likely" to hit certain pages, and from confirmation that users can use the tool as we have built it.

#### Global footer overview

The Stanford global footer is recommended to be placed at the bottom of all official university websites. It is designed to enhance sites with consistent Stanford branding and navigation, much like the brand bar and local header.
