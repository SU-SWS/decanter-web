## Browser

Decanter will officially support the latest version and one back of the following browsers:

* Edge 
* iOS Safari 
* OSX Safari
* Chrome Android 
* Chrome Desktop
* FireFox Desktop
* FireFox Android

Limited Support For:

* IE 11 

IE 11 will not have pixel perfect compatibility in Decanter. Some sacrifices may be made for modern browsers. If you need to support IE 11 for your work you will want to test and vet this product before committing to development.
