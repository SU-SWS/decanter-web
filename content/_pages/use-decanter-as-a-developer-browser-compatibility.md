## Browser

Decanter will officially support the latest version and one back of the following browsers:

* Chrome Desktop
* Chrome Android 
* FireFox Desktop
* FireFox Android
* OSX Safari
* iOS Safari
* Edge 

Limited Support For:

* IE 11 

IE 11 will not have pixel perfect compatibility in Decanter. Some sacrifices may be made for modern browsers. If you need to support IE 11 for your work you will want to test and vet this product before committing to development.
