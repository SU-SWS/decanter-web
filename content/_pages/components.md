## Our building blocks...

The Decanter components are a set of branded, documented, and accessible group of templates, SASS, and JavaScript. You can use them in a bootstrap like fashion by copying the HTML and CSS in to the correct places, or you can deeply integrate them with your build process.

Check out the [Get Started page](/page/use-decanter-as-a-developer-installation/) for more on how to use the Decanter code.

Check out the [As a Designer page](/page/use-decanter-as-a-designer/) for more on how to use the Decanter design assets.
