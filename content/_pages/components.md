## Our building blocks...

The Decanter components are a set of branded, documented, and accessible group of templates, SASS, and JavaScript. You can use them in a bootstrap like fashion by copying the HTML and CSS in to the correct places, or you can deeply integrate them with your build process.

Check out the [Get Started page](/page/use-decanter-as-a-developer-installation/) for more on how to use the Decanter code.

Check out the [As a Designer page](/page/use-decanter-as-a-designer/) for more on how to use the Decanter design assets. 

## View the components:

**Simple components** are foundational or structural components and are often the building blocks for the composite components, e.g., buttons.

**Composite components** are more complex than simple components and have less branding than the identity components. They usually have nested simple components or have more moving parts, e.g., cards.

**Identity components** are heavily branded components that are used to identify your website with the Stanford identity, e.g., the global footer.
