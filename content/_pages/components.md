## Our building blocks...

The Decanter components are a set of branded, documented, and accessible group of templates, SASS, and JavaScript. You can use them in a bootstrap like fashion by copying the HTML and CSS in to the correct places, or you can deeply integrate them with your build process.

Check out the [Get Started page](/page/use-decanter-as-a-developer-installation/) for more on how to use the Decanter code.

Check out the [As a Designer page](/page/use-decanter-as-a-designer/) for more on how to use the Decanter design assets.

### Simple Components

Foundational or structural components and are often the building blocks for the composite components, e.g., buttons.

### Composite Components

More complex than simple components and have less branding than the identity components. They usually have nested simple components or have more moving parts, e.g., cards and navigation menus.

### Identity Components

Heavily branded components that are used to identify your website with the Stanford identity, e.g., brand bar and global footer.
