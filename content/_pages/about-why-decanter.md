By using Decanter as a starting point, we want to enable you as campus designers, developers, and vendors to focus time, effort and creativity solving the challenges unique to your project. Decanter can be used out of the box to create a project, or it can be extended and modified to meet project needs. We believe that by sharing design and development efforts, we can co-create solutions that are elegant, usable and accessible.

## Benefits

### Usability & Accessibility

Decanter components have been tested for accessibility and usability. 

### Brand Compliance

Decanter has been developed in cooperation with University Communications to ensure that elements are in alignment with the [Stanford identity system](identity.stanford.edu).

### Get Started Quickly

Even if your project is likely to go in a very different visual direction, Decanter provides elements that can get you started quickly, whether it be designing layouts in Figma or implementing those designs in SASS.

## Use Decanter for:

* Official Stanford websites, including department, school, institutes, programs, and lab sites.
* External facing marketing or campaign websites
* News websites
