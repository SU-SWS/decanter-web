## Learn about Decanter

Decanter includes both the Decanter Design System, and the implementation of that system in frontend code (documented on this site). The Decanter Design System has been implemented for two purposes. To articulate new ideas for our frontend framework and see them through the collaborative ideation process where requirements, functionality, UX, and UI are defined. It’s second purpose is to become a rapid prototyping library for our communication and design teams across the University, where efficiencies can be made by using elements we all want to be sharing anyway, so we can spend our time on new and innovative ideas, instead of duplicative effort. 

## The tools

We build the living Decanter Design System elements in Figma. Figma is design software that our team at Stanford Web Services and University Communications specifically selected for these reasons. 

**Collaboration**: the software is cloud-based and allows for synchronized, multi-person editing in real time. All files are stored through Figma itself. No checking-in or checking-out of any files is necessary. 

**Libraries**: type, color, and master components can be created as shared libraries, of which any person on the enterprise Stanford Figma team can use. By simply toggling the Stanford Design System library on, you have access to branded colors, type styles, modular spacing, and basic components. You can also make libraries for use within your own team, and custom design work. Our goal with the Decanter Design System is to accelerate your work, but not to dictate your design outcomes. Creative freedom and flexibility are encouraged.

## Community Contribution

Having a shared central source for all Stanford digital design provides us the opportunity to share our work quickly and easily. Though the Decanter Design System is intentionally meant to be a baseline framework, and deliberately simplified and succinct, that doesn’t mean that other custom component libraries that we all create for other purposes cannot be shared between us as well.
