The Decanter team supports the most recent version and one back. The current version will be fully supported until the day the next major version is released and then at that point the previous version will go into bug and accessibility fixes only support. Bugfix support will last for one year. 

For example, if the current major version is 6.0.0 and version 7.0.0 is released next week, version 7.0.0 will become the new fully supported version and version 6.0.0 will go into bugfix and accessibility support for one year. Version 5.0.0 will then be marked as deprecated and no longer supported.

## Upcoming Version 7

The upcoming version 7 will have a major overhaul to the very core of Decanter. We will be switching to use a new tool and methadology called [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). We will strive to deprecate and create backwards compatibility where we can but with major versions and major change some things may break. 

The good news is that with the plans for the new Version 7 release, we should be able to be much more compatible with javascript based apps like those built on React, Vue, or Angular for example.
