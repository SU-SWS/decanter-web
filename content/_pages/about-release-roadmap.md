## Roadmap

We will publish a high-level roadmap in the coming months. Design and code issues are tracked on GitHub. To get a sense of current projects and priorities, you can take a look at our [Projects page on GitHub](https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter/projects).

## Release Schedule

Decanter releases a major version of the Decanter Frontend Framework each year.
