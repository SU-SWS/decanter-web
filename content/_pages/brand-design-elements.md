## Standards 

### Stanford websites must be accessible.

Stanford University is committed to providing an online environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.


###Design for all sized screens.

We can no longer assume what device a person will use to visit us on the web, so our websites should be developed for all screen sizes – from mobile to desktop.

###Make websites intuitive and easy to use.

We want to make it as easy and intuitive as possible for people to interact with us online. Be clear. Simplify.

###Use semantic markup.

We should follow code best practices with semantic HTML and CSS. This also helps with accessibility and usability.

###Create unity, not uniformity.

Our brand guidelines for websites make the Stanford web experience consistent while providing the flexibility needed to communicate unique messages. We have two essential web branding elements – the Stanford Brand Bar and Global Footer – that should be included in all Stanford websites. These are built into all our available templates.
