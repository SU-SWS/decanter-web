## Brand Elements

Stanford websites deserve consistency for visual language, and also for ease of use in the user experience.\

## Typography

Keeping our visual design system feel consistent is very often through our use of brand approved fonts.\

## Color

Beside our name and emblems, the most recognizable part of our Identity system is our color palette.\

Becoming more and more important to our University communications, particularly in our digital communications, we've made a variety of icon packs available through Decanter.\

## Standards

### Stanford websites must be accessible.

Stanford University is committed to providing an online environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.

**Accessibility practices across Stanford:** \
[Stanford Online Accessibility Policy](https://ucomm.stanford.edu/policies/accessibility-policy/)\
[Stanford's Accessibility Guidelines website](https://soap.stanford.edu/)

### Design for all sized screens.

We can no longer assume what device a person will use to visit us on the web, so our websites should be developed for all screen sizes – from mobile to desktop.

### Make websites intuitive and easy to use.

We want to make it as easy and intuitive as possible for people to interact with us online. Be clear. Simplify.

### Use semantic markup.

We should follow code best practices with semantic HTML and CSS. This also helps with accessibility and usability.

### Create unity, not uniformity.

Our brand guidelines for websites make the Stanford web experience consistent while providing the flexibility needed to communicate unique messages. We have two essential web branding elements – the Stanford Brand Bar and Global Footer – that should be included in all Stanford websites. These are built into all our available templates.

## Additional resources to build sites

### Do it Yourself

If you're also in need of a content management solution, Stanford has invested in website templates and themes for your use across the University on two platforms. If you're unsure where to start, see the options below, and also feel free to reach out to Stanford Web Services [through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZ8N06DW8LOKdGlcCfUIF8q8rQILh4A697qR5SoZ6-eWfG7g/viewform) for more information, and to talk you through options.

### Custom Websites

In situations where the templates available do not meet your needs, we have more robust options for website development on campus. This is a great place to start before seeking a vendor off-campus.

You can review the [Drupal themes](https://drupalthemes.stanford.edu/) and [WordPress themes](http://wordpressthemes.stanford.edu/) currently available on campus. Additionally, there is a [Drupal Community of Practice](https://opensource.stanford.edu/drupallers-cop), a [WordPress Community of Practice](http://wpcop.stanford.edu/), and a [User Experience Community of Practice](https://ux.stanford.edu/) who meet regularly.
