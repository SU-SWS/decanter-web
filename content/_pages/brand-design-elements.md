## Identity elements

Stanford websites deserve consistency for visual language, and also for ease of use in the user experience.

## Typography

Keeping our visual design system consistent is very often through our use of approved fonts.

## Color

Beside our name and emblems, the most recognizable part of our Identity system is our color palette.

## Icons

Becoming more and more important to our University communications, particularly in our digital communications, we've made a variety of icon packs available through Decanter.

## Standards

### Stanford websites must be accessible.

Stanford University is committed to providing an online environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.

### Design for all sized screens.

We can no longer assume what device a person will use to visit us on the web, so our websites should be developed for all screen sizes – from mobile to desktop.

### Make websites intuitive and easy to use.

We want to make it as easy and intuitive as possible for people to interact with us online. Be clear. Simplify.

### Use semantic markup.

We should follow code best practices with semantic HTML and CSS. This also helps with accessibility and usability.

### Create unity, not uniformity.

Our identity guidelines make the Stanford web experience consistent while still providing the flexibility needed to communicate unique messages. We have two essential web branding elements – the Stanford Brand Bar and Global Footer – that should be included in all Stanford websites. These are built into all our available templates.
