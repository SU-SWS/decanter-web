READY FOR REVIEW

Decanter has been created from partnership between [Stanford Web Services](https://uit.stanford.edu/sws) and [University Communications](https://ucomm.stanford.edu/). Technical leadership and design direction are currently provided by members of both of these teams, but we are always looking for new collaborators.

If you  want to be involved in our ongoing work, please reach out to us via the #decanter channel on Slack.

We aim for, and look for, contributions that are:

* Platform-agnostic
* Maintainable
* Reusable
* Brand compliant
* Accessible
* Meet our [Coding Standards](page/use-decanter-as-a-developer-code-standards)

Please see both our [Technical Contribution Guidelines](/page/about-contributing/) and our [Visual Guidelines](/page/visual-guidelines/) for more details.
