## Request a Component

All new requests for components will be evaluated, beginning with a discovery process that includes an audit of visual patterns. Factors such as reusability across the product ecosystem (ideally can be used by 3-5 teams), investment, and maturity of the product, and team bandwidth are also taken into account.

New feature and enhancement requests can be submitted using the **Feature Request Form**.

## Report an Issue

The Decanter team is committed to maintaining consistent, high-quality components. If you encounter any defects in the Figma Toolkit, or on the documentation site, please [submit an issue to our Github project](https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter) and it will be added to the backlog.

The team will address the bug as soon as possible, depending on the severity of the issue and the sprint capacity. Please include as much relevant information as possible when submitting a bug report, including steps to reproduce, urgency, and impact to help prioritize the task.

If you have a fix for the bug and would like to submit a PR for it, please reach out in Slack at #decanter or visit the Contributing to Decanter page to learn more about contribution opportunities.
