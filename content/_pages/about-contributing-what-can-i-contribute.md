## What we accept

When considering new components and functionality for Decanter, we need to ensure it will serve the needs of the broader University community and does not duplicate existing functionality. The following criteria should be met for features and functionality improvements:

* Reusable (content-agnostic)
* Component/element has a clear use case
* Addresses accessibility and usability (see accessibility
* Considers evolving web trends

### Out of Scope for Decanter

* Content-specific design elements

## Join the Decanter Design community

Our teams at Stanford Web Services and University Communication encourage contribution to the Stanford Design System. Though our goal remains to be the to keep the system as succinct and simplified as possible—to provide a baseline framework of the essential elements—we are very aware that that baseline is not there yet, and will need perpetual refactoring and optimization. 

Please [contact us on Slack](/page/about-contributing-how-to-communicate/) if you are interested in collaborating and contributing to the Stanford Design System.
