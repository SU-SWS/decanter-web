### Do it Yourself

If you're also in need of a content management solution, Stanford has invested in website templates and themes for your use across the University on two platforms. If you're unsure where to start, see the options below, and also feel free to reach out to Stanford Web Services [through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZ8N06DW8LOKdGlcCfUIF8q8rQILh4A697qR5SoZ6-eWfG7g/viewform) for more information, and to talk you through options.

### Custom Websites

In situations where the templates available do not meet your needs, we have more robust options for website development on campus. This is a great place to start before seeking a vendor off-campus.

You can review the [Drupal themes](https://drupalthemes.stanford.edu/) and [WordPress themes](http://wordpressthemes.stanford.edu/) currently available on campus. Additionally, there is a [Drupal Community of Practice](https://opensource.stanford.edu/drupallers-cop), a [WordPress Community of Practice](http://wpcop.stanford.edu/), and a [User Experience Community of Practice](https://ux.stanford.edu/) who meet regularly.
