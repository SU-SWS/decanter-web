## Designers

<p class="su-alert"><strong>Please note:</strong> Figma does not currently have the single sign on functionality in place for the educational context that would allow us to move forward with an organizational license. We are continuing to work with them to add this functionality, but have no estimated time of delivery.</p> 

Through our Decanter Design System in Figma, you will be able to start with a preexisting library of components with built in type and color styles. Grids, modular spacing, and responsive design have also been fully implemented in this design system. Take all of the foundational objects that are useful to you and unsync from an object's master component to generate a starting point for modifying your cards, banners, buttons, etc. It's a great resource to use directly or to modify to fit your project needs. 

## Additional resources to build sites

### Do it Yourself

If you're also in need of a content management solution, Stanford has invested in website templates and themes for your use across the University on two platforms. If you're unsure where to start, see the options below, and also feel free to reach out to Stanford Web Services [through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZ8N06DW8LOKdGlcCfUIF8q8rQILh4A697qR5SoZ6-eWfG7g/viewform) for more information, and to talk you through options.

### Custom Websites

In situations where the templates available do not meet your needs, we have more robust options for website development on campus. This is a great place to start before seeking a vendor off-campus.

You can review the [Drupal themes](https://drupalthemes.stanford.edu/) and [WordPress themes](http://wordpressthemes.stanford.edu/) currently available on campus. Additionally, there is a [Drupal Community of Practice](https://opensource.stanford.edu/drupallers-cop), a [WordPress Community of Practice](http://wpcop.stanford.edu/), and a [User Experience Community of Practice](https://ux.stanford.edu/) who meet regularly.
