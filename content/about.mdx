Decanter is Stanford’s open source design and frontend framework for digital products and experiences. Use Decanter to create user interfaces consistent with Stanford’s brand guidelines and best practices across user experience and accessibility.

Decanter provides a set of reusable atoms, style variables, design assets, and a responsive layout system that can be used in any Stanford project. The product includes both  the Decanter Design System built in Figma and the Decanter Frontend Framework in code and is  maintained by a team of designers, developers, and writers at Stanford. We provide guidance for teams to efficiently build high-quality, user friendly, and accessible websites through our documentation, but you can also participate in bi-weekly Decanter project-team meetings and <a href="https://stanfordwebservices.slack.com/archives/C9SL2179B">join us on Slack</a>. Are you part of the Stanford digital community? You’re invited to collaborate with the Decanter team to help evolve the system as product needs change.
