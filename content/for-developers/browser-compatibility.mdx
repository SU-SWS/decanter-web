<Section heading="Decanter supports many versions of browsers and is configurable by you.">
We recommend that you use browserlist to configure your browser support. See more [documenation on how to configure browserlist and tailwindcss here.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#future-css-features)

We recommend using the `default` preset for most projects. This will support the last 2 versions of all major browsers and has good global coverage.

More information on the default setting can be found on the [browserlist website](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#best-practices).
