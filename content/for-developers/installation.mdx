[Decanter v7](https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter/tree/v7) customizes Tailwind CSS for you to generate utility classes that works with our design system. Before you begin, please read and review the installation process on the official [Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). Please also become familiar with [Tailwind CSS presets](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) as Decanter uses this functionality to make it even easier for you to use.

<Section heading="Install the resources">
If you are adding Decanter to an existing project please have a review of the [Framework Guides](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) available from Tailwind CSS and then skip to the tailwind.config.js settings below.

<div className="children:children:su-rs-mb-4">
1. **Install Decanter Tailwindcss**

    The easiest way to add Decanter to your project is to use the npm package manager.

    ```shell
    npm install -D decanter
    npx tailwind init
    ```

2. **Configure your tailwind.config.js file**

    Configure your project to use the Decanter preset of Tailwind CSS and point

    ```js
    module.exports = {
    // Prefix is optional but this is the Decanter convention
      prefix: 'su-',
      // This preset option pulls in all of the Tailwind CSS configuration.
      presets: [
        require('decanter')
      ],
      // This should point to your source files as Tailwind CSS scans your files for the css classes you use.
      content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```


3. **Add the tailwind directives to your main CSS file.**

    `/src/css/main.css`

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

4. **Compile using the Tailwind CSS CLI tool**

    Run the CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and build your CSS.

    ```shell
    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css/main.css -o ./dist/css/styles.css --watch
    ```

5. **Add the compiled css to your project**

    Add your compiled CSS file to the `<head>` and start using Tailwind's utility classes to style your content.

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <link href="/dist/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
      <h2 class="su-type-1 su-font-bold su-underline">
        Hello world!
      </h2>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

6. **Start developing**
