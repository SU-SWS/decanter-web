<Section heading="Roadmap">
We continue to meet bi-weekly, with an open Decanter forum to discuss enhancements, learn what our community needs, and plan for upcoming work. We have an open <a href="https://stanfordwebservices.slack.com/archives/C9SL2179B">Decanter Slack channel</a>. And community members across Stanford are invited to participate in any way they’re supported to do so. But as the source of enhancements have shifted to project-based roadmaps, we’re currently in a period where Decanter is influenced largely by our project sponsors. Design and code decisions are led namely by the Web Services architects and implementors who are the primary users of Decanter V7 to keep the project evolving and reduce stagnation.

<Section heading="Upgrade paths">
Due to the fundamental shift moving away from Twig templates + SCSS in Decanter version 6 to Tailwind CSS in Decanter version 7, there will not be an upgrade path between the two versions.

After the release of a stable version 7, we will support 1 year of bug and security fixes for version 6, but will not add any additional feature development.
