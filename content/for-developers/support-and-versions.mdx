<Section heading="Roadmap">
We continue to meet regularly, with an open Decanter forum to discuss enhancements, learn what our community needs, and plan for upcoming work. We have an open <a href="https://stanfordwebservices.slack.com/archives/C9SL2179B">Decanter Slack channel</a> and community members across Stanford are invited to participate in any way they’re supported to do so. As the source of enhancements have shifted to project-based roadmaps, we’re currently in a period where Decanter is influenced largely by our project sponsors. Design and code decisions are led namely by the Web Services architects and implementors who are the primary users of Decanter V7 to keep the project evolving and reduce stagnation. You are welcome to submit requests through <a href="https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter/issues">GitHub issues</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter/pulls">Pull Requests.</a>
