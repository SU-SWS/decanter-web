Modular typography provides a convenient way to scale font sizes and keep them proportional for all breakpoints. The “modular” part comes from the [modular scale concept](https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography/#section2), which is a set of numbers that increase by a fixed ratio or multiplier between them. If this multiplier is bigger, the series of numbers increases faster, i.e., each step is further apart.

In Decanter, the modular typography classes use the em unit and we set `su-type-0` (type stands for typography) to equal `1em`, meaning if you use the `su-basefont-23` class ([see previous section on base font size](/for-developers/strategies-and-conventions/base-font-size-and-scales)) in the root, `su-type-0` would be `2.3rem` or `23px`. From then on, we provide 9 typography steps from `su-type-1` to `su-type-9` with a fixed ratio (modular scale multiplier) between each step.

We also realize that font sizes should go up at a different rate between mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints. It makes sense to have really large “splash” typography in the hero banner on the desktop version of a site that is e.g., `160px`, which would look enormous on a phone screen. For this reason, we have 3 different modular scale multipliers for the different device sizes as below:
- Mobile (XS-SM): 1.15
- Tablet (MD): 1.2
- Desktop (LG to 2XL): 1.25

What does this all mean? Let’s look at an example. Let’s say we using the class `su-type-7` for a hero banner headline, below would be the rendered font sizes at each breakpoint range assuming one uses the `su-basefont-23` class (`18px` for XS-SM, `21px` for MD-XL, `23px` for 2XL) in root:
- Mobile: `18px` * 1.15<sup>7</sup> = `48px` (base font size for mobile multiply by 1.15 7 times since we’re on step #7)
- Tablet: `21px` * 1.2<sup>7</sup> = `75px`
- Desktop between LG to XL = `21px` * 1.25<sup>7</sup> = `100px`
- Desktop from 2XL breakpoint and up: `23px` * 1.25<sup>7</sup> = `109px`

As you can see, by applying the single modular typography class `su-type-7` to the headline, you get an appropriately sized typography element for all breakpoint ranges.
