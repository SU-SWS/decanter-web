Decanter is a design system for Stanford, built as an accelerant for designers to achieve brand compliance, meet accessibility standards, and employ shared design styles.  You can use Decanter components and styles out of the box, and/or spend your time customizing a Decanter-based library to use for your projects. Decanter is built in Figma.
