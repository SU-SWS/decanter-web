At this time, if you would like to use Figma, your individual team (or designer) will need to sign up independently. Figma is free to use for those in education. Teams at Stanford can employ the Decanter component library by copying and pasting elements from Decanter into their own projects. But please note, this process may require manual updates in the future as the design library evolves. 

Please [contact us on Slack](https://stanfordwebservices.slack.com/archives/C9SL2179B) if you would like more information, or email Kerri Augenstein. (The copy and paste process will be manual, and require connection with a design team member at Stanford Web Services.)
