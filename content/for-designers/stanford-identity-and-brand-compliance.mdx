    All Stanford department, program, lab, school, and administrative unit websites are encouraged to include two components to align their websites with Stanford’s Identity system:

    <ul className="rs-mb-1">
      <li>
        [Stanford global identity bar](https://decanter.stanford.edu/examples/identity-bar)
      </li>
      <li>
        [Stanford global footer](https://decanter.stanford.edu/examples/global-footer)
      </li>
    </ul>
    Outside of these two components, we urge you to adhere to typographic and color recommendations, particularly as they impact accessibility.
    In general terms, the [Stanford Identity](https://identity.stanford.edu) team wants you to be innovative and creative in how you interpret and express the Stanford Identity.

    ## Stanford global identity bar overview
    <div className="rs-mb-1">
      The Stanford global identity bar came out of a need to provide a “home” for all Stanford websites, both visually and functionally.
      This bar, containing the Stanford logo, anchors to the top of your website, above your local header. It serves visually as the main Stanford University mark, and functionally, it links back to homesite,
      [www.stanford.edu](http://www.stanford.edu/). By providing a consistent global “bar” at the top of websites, our ecosystem of sites feel deliberate and understandable to users.

    ## Stanford global footer overview
    <div className="rs-mb-1">
      The Stanford global footer is strongly recommended to be placed at the bottom of all official university websites. It is designed to enhance sites with consistent Stanford branding and navigation, much like the brand bar and local header. It also contains crucial links for emergency information and satisfying legal requirements.
